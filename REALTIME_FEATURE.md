   - Thread-safe quaternion updates
   - Smooth 30 FPS animation
   - Auto-calibration support

2. **`test_realtime_viz.py`** - Test script with simulated data
   - No hardware required
   - Demonstrates bicep curl motion
   - Perfect for testing installation

3. **`README_REALTIME.md`** - Complete documentation
   - Installation guide
   - Usage instructions
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Updated Files

1. **`gui_app.py`** - Added "Live Recording" button
   - Records data AND shows real-time visualization
   - Thread-safe operation
   - Auto-fills visualization field after recording

2. **`GUI_USAGE.md`** - Updated with new feature documentation
   - Workflow guides
   - Tips for best results

3. **`requirements.txt`** - Already had all needed packages!
   - numpy < 2.0.0 (compatible with Movella SDK)
   - matplotlib >= 3.3.0
   - pandas >= 1.2.0
   - keyboard >= 0.13.5

## How to Use

### Option 1: With Real Devices

```bash
# Activate environment
.\venv39\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run GUI
python gui_app.py
```

1. Click "Setup Devices" (make sure DOTs are on)
2. Click "Live Recording"
3. 3D window opens showing your arm in real-time
4. Perform your movement
5. Watch yourself move on screen!

### Option 2: Test Without Devices

```bash
# Activate environment
.\venv39\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run test
python test_realtime_viz.py
```

This shows a simulated bicep curl - perfect for testing!

### Thread Safety
- Mutex locks protect quaternion data
- Non-blocking updates
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Performance
- Recording: ~100 Hz (10ms intervals)
- Visualization: ~30 FPS (33ms intervals)
- No data loss with proper synchronization

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Before (gui_app.py v1)
- Record data → Save → Open visualization → Play animation
- No real-time feedback
- Can't see movement as it happens

### After (gui_app.py v2) ⭐
- Click "Live Recording"
- See 3D arm movement INSTANTLY
- Record data simultaneously
- Immediate feedback for form correction

## Next Steps

You can now:

1. **Test the system**: Run `python test_realtime_viz.py`
2. **Use with real devices**: Run `python gui_app.py`
3. **Customize**: Modify arm lengths in `RealtimeArmVisualizer()`
4. **Extend**: Add more body segments or different movements

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Positioning**: Place laptop where you can see screen while moving
2. **Calibration**: Start in neutral position (arm straight down)
3. **Smooth Movements**: Slow, controlled motions look best
4. **Lighting**: Good lighting helps you see both screen and movement
5. **Duration**: Start with 10-15 seconds, increase as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Window doesn't open
- Check matplotlib is installed
- Try closing other apps
- Run test script first

### Choppy animation
- Close other applications
- Reduce recording duration
- Check CPU usage

### Can't see movement
- Verify devices are sending data
- Check calibration was successful
- Ensure you moved after calibration

## Success! 🎊

You now have a complete real-time motion capture and visualization system!

Enjoy your real-time arm tracking! 💪
